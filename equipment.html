            <p>Before we pump up our boots and get ready for a fast-paced game of basketball, let us know a little bit about the history of basketball. Basketball was the brainchild of James Naismith. He was born in Almonte, Ontario and was a Canadian physical education instructor. When Naismith was an instructor at the Springfield College (Massachusetts), with the help of American physical education specialist, he invented the game basketball in 1891. Over the century, rules of basketball have undergone a lot of change. Today, high school, college and professional basketball, all are played in a similar fashion. The difference lies between the length and the range of basic skills. There are five players in each team and they play the game with a single ball. The aim is to shoot the maximum number of baskets in the hoop and win the game.</p>
            <p>Basketball is one of the most popular games around the world. If one has a basketball and a hoop, they can play this game indoors as well as outdoors. If one is a professional, they will definitely need most of the equipment to practice. But, if one is just starting out and learning a few tricks of the trade, then the basic necessities will suffice their needs.</p>
